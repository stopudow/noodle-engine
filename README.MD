## Noodle Engine

Yet another game engine, a lightweight web-based engine that utilizes the Canvas API for rendering graphics and the Web Audio API/HTML Audio for sound. 
It's designed for creating 2D games, and uses nodes and inheritance to create objects, levels and etc.

**Important Note**: This engine is primarily a personal project and is not complete. Therefore, it is not recommended to use it in production, as there may be errors and shortcomings.
